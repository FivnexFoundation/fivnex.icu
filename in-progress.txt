Hello, this is a note saying that this site is still under heavy construction. 
None of the information here is usable as of yet, due to the fact that the web
developers are still working on actually getting the site into a usable state!

This site is, in fact, only online and visible for testing. Do not expect any-
thing of particular interest yet. Many web pages are still broken. We are just
trying to make sure everything functions as intended.

Thank you for your interest in the Fivnex Improving Computational Understandi-
ng. We hope to build something wonderful with our experiments.   These are not
products by Fivnex or the Fivnex Foundation. FICU is owned by the Fivnex Foun-
dation.  None of these are officially products,  and are not recommended to be
used in professional productions.
